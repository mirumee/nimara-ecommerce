# Marketing & Documentation Alignment

## Principle
Website copy and docs must reflect how the product actually works:
- packages, not templates
- providers, not hardcoded integrations
- thin storefront orchestrator
- feature packages
- action factories + app wrappers
- routing injection + modular i18n
- overrides model

## Website pages that must emphasize architecture
- Homepage: Commerce OS + diagram + CLI flow
- Storefront: thin orchestrator + features + providers + actions + routing/i18n
- Apps & Integrations: provider model + manifests + swapping
- Developer Experience: overrides, DI, actions, monorepo
- Enterprise: multi-brand, multi-store, replaceable integrations, governance

## Docs IA should mirror DX
- Getting Started
- Add Providers
- Add Features
- Override
- Deploy
- Architecture deep dives
