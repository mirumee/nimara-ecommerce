# Running Locally

To run a local development environment, you need to set up the Saleor instance first. You can use a free developer account at [Saleor Cloud](https://docs.saleor.io/cloud) to start quickly with the backend. Alternatively, you can run [Saleor locally](https://docs.saleor.io/quickstart/running-locally) using Docker.
