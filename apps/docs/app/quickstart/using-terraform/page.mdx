# Using Terraform

Nimara Storefront can be deployed to Vercel using Terraform. This allows you to manage your infrastructure as code which is particularly useful for automating deployments and managing configurations across different environments.
This guide will walk you through the steps how to do it.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- Installed [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
- An access to the [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/account/settings)
- Forked the [Nimara Ecommerce](https://github.com/mirumee/nimara-ecommerce) repository to your GitHub account
- Configured [Saleor](https://saleor.io/) instance

<Steps>

### Clone the forked Repository

First, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/nimara-ecommerce.git
```

### Configure Terraform

Navigate to the directory where the Terraform configuration files are located:

```bash
cd nimara-ecommerce/terraform/storefront
```

Initialize Terraform (this downloads the necessary provider plugins):

```bash
terraform init
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Now it's time to set up the environment variables (both private and public) required for the storefront deployment.

Copy the **private** variable file template to a new file named `private.auto.tfvars`:

```bash
cp example.private.auto.tfvars private.auto.tfvars
```

<Callout type="warning">
  This file will contain sensitive information and should not be committed to
  version control. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.
</Callout>

Edit the new `private.auto.tfvars` file and add your environment variables, replacing the `CHANGE_ME` placeholders with your actual values.
These variables are essential for the storefront to function correctly, including Saleor app token, authentication secret, and Stripe secret key and must be keep private.
What they are and how to get them is described in the [Environment Variables](https://docs.nimara.store/quickstart/environment-variables) section.
Vercel variables can be obtained from your Vercel account settings.

```hcl filename="terraform/storefront/private.auto.tfvars"
# This file cannot be committed to version control as it contains sensitive information.

# Can be found in your Vercel team settings - https://vercel.com/YOUR_TEAM_NAME/~/settings.
# Look for the `Team ID` section and copy the ID. Example: `team_1234567890abcdef`.
# Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.
vercel_team_id = "CHANGE_ME"

# Can be generated in your Vercel account settings - https://vercel.com/account/settings/tokens
# Give it a descriptive name, assign a proper scope and expiration date.
# Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.
vercel_api_token = "CHANGE_ME"

# Map of private environment variables to be set in the Vercel project. Put sensitive information here.
private_environment_variables = {
  "SALEOR_APP_TOKEN": {
    comment = "Required. Saleor app token for the storefront."
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "AUTH_SECRET": {
    comment = "Required. Secret key for authentication."
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": {
    comment = "Required. Secret key for Stripe payments."
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

Next step is to configure **public** environment variables in the similar way.
Copy the **public** variable file template to a new file named `public.auto.tfvars`.

```bash
cp example.public.auto.tfvars public.auto.tfvars
```

Edit the new `public.auto.tfvars` file and fill in the values for the public environment variables.

```hcl filename="terraform/storefront/public.auto.tfvars"
# Rename this file to `public.auto.tfvars` and fill in the values.
# This file can be committed to version control as it should contain only public information.

# GitHub repository for the Vercel project.
# Format: "owner/repo". Example: "mirumee/nimara-ecommerce".
github_repository = ""

# Repository branch to deploy to production. If not set, it will default to "main".
github_production_branch = "main"

# Vercel project name. If not set, it will default to "nimara-ecommerce".
vercel_project_name = "nimara-ecommerce"

# Optional. List of additional environments with their configurations.
# Example:
# additional_environments = [
#   {
#     name = "qa"
#     github_branch = "qa"
#     domain = "qa.vercel.app"
#   }
# ]
additional_environments = []

# Map of public environment variables to be set in the Vercel project.
public_environment_variables = {
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_SALEOR_API_URL" = {
    comment = "Public Saleor API URL for the storefront"
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "https://{YOUR_SALEOR_DOMAIN}/graphql/"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL" = {
    comment = "Default channel slug for the storefront"
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }]
  },
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL" = {
    comment = "Public URL of the storefront. If not set, it will default to the Vercel project domain."
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "https://{YOUR_STOREFRONT_DOMAIN}"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  }
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY" = {
    comment = "Public Stripe key for the storefront"
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_APP_ID": {
    comment = "Public ID of the payment app for the storefront"
    envs_values = [
      {
        value = "CHANGE_ME"
        target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
      }
    ]
  }
}


```

### Deploy the Storefront

After configuring the environment variables, you can deploy the storefront to Vercel using Terraform.

First, run the following command to see what changes will be made:

```bash
terraform plan
```

If everything looks good, you can apply the changes to deploy the storefront:
This command will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed with the deployment.

```bash
terraform apply
```

If you have configured everything correctly, Terraform will create the necessary resources in Vercel and deploy your storefront.
